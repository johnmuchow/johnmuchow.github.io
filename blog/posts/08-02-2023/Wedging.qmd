[David Ryan](https://twitter.com/dryan310), 3 time U.S Investing Champion, has shared numerous examples of wedging on IBD Live. In a wedge, stocks are typically in a downtrend. In this pattern, prices are showing lower highs and lower lows. This indicates a lack of upward momentum and usually precedes further weakness.

### Characteristics of Wedging Stocks

▪ Slow moves up, quick moves down  
▪ Wedges rarely make new highs  
▪ Volume is often below average  
▪ Lower highs and lower lows
