I wrote a TradingView indicator to auto-detect Average Volume Weighted Average Price (AVWAP) gap ups. This historical analysis looks for specific entry criteria based on [@Alphatrends](https://twitter.com/alphatrends) book, Anchored VWAP.

▪ Closes below AVWAP (pullback)  
▪ Lows above AVWAP (rally back above)  

This same concept applies on multiple timeframes.
