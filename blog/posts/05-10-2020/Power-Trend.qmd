## What is a Power Trend

Here are the primary considerations for a market to be considered in a [Power Trend](https://www.tradingview.com/script/CzyVIdMM-Power-Trend-Pro-Spot-Powerful-Uptrends/)

- Low above the 21-day for 10 consecutive days.
- 21-day above the 50-day for five days, without a break below the 50-day.
- 50-day in an uptrend.

If the criteria above are met, for a power trend to begin, it must be an up day. Once the 21-day crosses below the 50-day that is a sign the trend may be coming to an end. There are “circuit-breaker rules” that can end a PT before the 21-day to 50-day crossover.

It should be noted, I am using the Nasdaq for all the charts that follow.
