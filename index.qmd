Welcome. My name is John Muchow. I have 35+ years of software design and development experience. I graduated in 1988 with a Master's degree in Computer Science. I've written extensively about software development, including a best-selling mobile application developer book published in five languages.

## Portfolio

This website is a portfolio covering much of my work in software development. My current focus is technical analysis and design/development of custom indicators for [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/u/JohnMuchow/#published-scripts).


## Technical Indicators

I've had the great fortune to design and build custom trading tools with two professional traders, both who've competed in the U.S. Investing Championship. 

#### Matt Caruso

[Matt](https://twitter.com/Trader_mcaruso) is a professional trader who had a 346% return in the 2020 U.S. Investing Championship. I did all the software design and development for Matt's Growth Investor Charting Package:

▪ [Caruso Adaptive Relative Strength (CA|RS)](https://www.carusoinsights.com/cars/)  
▪ [Caruso Divergence Relative Strength (CD|RS)](https://www.carusoinsights.com/cdrs/)  
▪ [Caruso Financial Dashboard (CF|DB)](https://www.carusoinsights.com/cfdb/)  
▪ [Caruso Market Dashboard (CM|DB)](Caruso Market Dashboard (CM|DB))

#### David Ryan

[David](https://twitter.com/dryan310) is a three time U.S Investing Champion: 1985, 1986, 1987. David was a Portfolio Manager at O’Neil & Co and worked directly with William O'Neil for many years. David and I collaborated on several custom indicators:

▪ [Ants — Momentum, Volume and Price (MVP)](https://www.tradingview.com/script/uEaFv7tm-Ants-Momentum-Volume-and-Price-MVP/) - In-depth analysis of momentum, volume & price action.

#### Top Ranking TradingView Indicators  

Many of my TradingView indicators are quite popular, here are a few top-ranking tools:

▪ [RS Line - Gauge Performance vs Index](https://www.tradingview.com/script/cClLGtbd-RS-Line-Gauge-Performance-vs-Index/)

## Blog - Technical Analysis & Educational Content

Given my years of experience working with various software tools, creating custom chart annotations comes easy. One of my earliest forays into this area was creating charts to accompany [Mike Webster's](http://twitter.com/mwebster1971) [Stock Market Update](https://www.investors.com/tag/weekend-stock-market-update/) column for Investor's Business Daily. Mike was previously IBD Head Market Strategist, O’Neil Capital Portfolio Manager. Mike was a William O'Neil protege. You can view several of these annotations in the list below. 

I've also included content gathered from various blogs I've written over the years as well as more recent content that I've started to publish.
