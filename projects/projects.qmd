##  Contra Software

As both an employee and investor of Contra Software, I was a Principal Software Engineer, focused on design and development of the iOS applications. Our application was used by NBC Universal to track and manage projects for both TV and film productions. Video walk-throughs of our flagship application, Studio Fusion, will be available soon.


## Softcard - Mobile Payments Platform

[Softcard Mobile Payment Platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softcard)

I was the Sr. iOS Architect for this unique mobile payment platform. Softcard (formerly known as Isis) allowed consumers to make payments at retail stores using their smartphones. 

The technology used NFC (near field communication) to transmit payment information from the phone to the POS terminal. 
I designed and developed the iOS wallet application, as well as the iOS SDK for merchants. 
I worked closely with the engineering teams at AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and the payment networks Visa and Mastercard.
The project was eventually shut down, but it was a very interesting experience working on mobile payments early on. The technology and concepts behind Softcard are still relevant today.


## mFoundry - Mojax

Coming soon...
