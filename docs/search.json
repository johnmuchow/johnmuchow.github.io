The more charts you view, the more obvious it becomes that nothing has changed with supply/demand and human psychology.

Here’s a chart from 1986:\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing are charts for Zoom (ZM), both daily and weekly.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the price is contracting, notice that the volume is also declining. Upon breakout, the price action continued in the direction of the prior trend. Notice the same action for Costco (COST).\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily and weekly charts of TSLA show consistent price tightening and declining volume.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with all technical patterns, this is an art, not science. With that said, tightening price action with a decline in volume may foretell a continuation of the prior trend. It’s worth some time to study and look for this pattern."

If you are looking at a weekly chart, the RS Line is the performance of the stock over the past week versus the S&P 500 over that same time frame. The same logic applies to the daily and monthly charts, only the time frames are different.\nIf a stock moves up for the day/week/month and the S&P 500 does not, the RS Line will move up. If a stock ends the day/week/month flat, but the S&P 500 moves up, the RS Line will go down.\nThe daily chart can have a little more “noise” as it reflects price movements on a more frequent basis. Look to the weekly and monthly RS Line to get a view of the longer term trend."

Jesse referred to this as a pivotal point.\nThe “+ 3” aspect came about as O’Neil’s example was based on a stock that was $30/share, hence, 10% of $30 is $3, so it was known as a shakeout + $3."

It starts with a recent low undercutting a previous low:\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the two lows shown above, here are the steps to calculate a shakeout + 3 entry point:\n\nStep #1 - Get two recent low values:\nOriginal low: $73.85 Undercut low: 73.76\n\n\nStep #2: Calculate prices at 5% and 10% of original low:\n5% of $73.85 = $3.70 10% of $73.85 = $7.40\n\n\nStep #3 - Calculate early entry range:\nThe range is the original low plus the 5% and 10% values from above: Range = $77.55 ($73.85 + $3.70) to $81.25 ($73.85 + $7.40)\n\n\nStep #4 - Look for an area of resistance:\nAs with the range, an area of resistance was not part of the original concept described by Livermore or O’Neil. Using prior resistance you can find a more logical area to enter a trade.\nIn the figure below I’ve highlighted the early entry range ($77.55 to $81.25). The orange line is an area of resistance, notice several times in the past the price action didn’t move beyond that level."

It was one of the first books that focused on mobile app development, specifically J2ME , a platform designed to write portable code for mobile devices (phones and personal digital assistants) as well as embedded devices (micro-controllers, sensors, gateways and TV set-top boxes).\nThe book was a best-seller on Amazon in the mobile development category and was published in five languages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPC Magazine published the article Inside JavaBeans on October 6, 1998.
